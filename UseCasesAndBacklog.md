## Concept
  The overall goal of the application is for the user to pick one of the two monsters onscreen and vote for which they like better. The monsters will be pseudo-randomly generated for each voting round. There will be images representing each monster and a way to match their vote count with the database in order to rank them later on. The user will be able to view the current rankings of each monster. No authentication and such required. Votes will be counted and stored to the database. The rankings page will contain the results of those votes being pulled from the database.  

## Core Use Cases
1.  Designing the layouts and getting the pages displaying properly for mobile and desktop
2.  Gathering all monsters to be displayed for voting
3.  Psuedo-randomly generate two monsters for voting
4.  Process the vote to the database
5.  Build a ranking algorithm 
6.  Pull voting data for each monster from database
7.  Display correct ranking for each monster on Ranking page

## Backlog
 1.  Use metrics to determine how many people voted
 2.  Set up hosting for voting app
